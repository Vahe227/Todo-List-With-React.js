# Todo List Application with React.js

## üìö Description

This project is a simple Todo List application built with React.js. It allows users to manage their daily tasks by adding new items, marking tasks as completed, and deleting them. A unique feature of this project is the ability to see how many tasks have been completed. The codebase is thoroughly commented to help new programmers understand the meaning and function of each section, making it an excellent resource for learning React.

A special note on styling: The CSS code used in this project was generated with the assistance of Google Gemini AI. As a backend developer, my primary focus is on functionality. This AI-generated CSS helped enhance the project's visual appeal efficiently.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Technologies

* **React.js:** The core of this project is built using React.js, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **JSX:** JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript, enabling the writing of HTML-like code directly within JavaScript. It's fundamental to React for describing UI structures, significantly improving code readability.
* **Node.js:** Although no direct Node.js code is present, Node.js is crucial for running this React project. It provides the JavaScript runtime environment necessary for npm (Node Package Manager) and for executing build and development scripts.
* **ES6 Modules:** This project extensively uses ES6 modules for organizing the codebase. This modular approach ensures that each file's code (import/export) is linked efficiently, promoting better code organization and maintainability.
* **npm:** Used for managing project dependencies and running various scripts (e.g., starting the development server, building the project).

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

The project follows a modular architecture, enhancing readability, understandability, and extensibility. The codebase is divided into logical parts, each responsible for specific functionality.

public/ directory: Contains static assets served directly by the web server.

* **`index.html:` The main HTML file where the React application is mounted.
* **`manifest.json:` A web app manifest file providing meta-information about the web application (e.g., name, icons, display mode) for Progressive Web App (PWA) features.
* **`favicon.ico:` The favicon displayed in the browser tab.
* **`logo192.png / logo512.png:` Default React logos, not directly used in the application's UI, but important for PWA icons.
* **`robots.txt:` A file providing instructions to web crawlers about which parts of the site they can or cannot crawl.

src/ directory: Contains the core React application source code.

* **`App.js:` The main component orchestrating the entire Todo application. It manages the global state and passes data/functions to child components.
* **`App.css:` Contains global styling for the application, enhancing its visual appeal.
* **`index.js:` The entry point of the React application. It's responsible for importing necessary libraries (React, ReactDOM), finding the HTML element (<div id="root">) where the app should be mounted, and rendering the main App component into it.
* **`TodoClear.js:` Manages the functionality for clearing all completed tasks from the list.
* **`TodoDone.js:` Handles the logic and UI for adding new tasks to the list.
* **`TodoInputes.js:` Represents a single todo item, handling actions like marking as completed and deleting individual tasks.
* **`TodoLine.js:` Responsible for rendering the entire list of todo items, iterating over the task data and passing individual task props to TodoInputes.js.
* **`package.json:` This file lists the project's metadata, dependencies, and scripts, essential for managing the project's environment.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up and run this project locally.

### Prerequisites
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes installed with Node.js)

Creating a New React Project
If you don't have a React project set up yet:

1. Open your Terminal (for MacOS/Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (for Windows).
Run the following command to create a new React project:
Bash

2. npx create-react-app %PROJECT_NAME%
(Replace %PROJECT_NAME% with your desired project name, e.g., my-todo-app). This command will set up a new React project in the current directory.
Open the newly created project folder in VS Code (or your preferred code editor) and integrate the Todo list application files into their respective src/ and public/ directories.
Running the Project
Once the project files are in place:

3. Open your Terminal (or Command Prompt/PowerShell).
Navigate to your project's root directory using the cd command (e.g., cd my-todo-app).
Install the project dependencies (only required once, or if package.json changes):
Bash

npm install
# Or, if you prefer Yarn:
# yarn install
Start the development server:
Bash

npm start
# Or, if you prefer Yarn:
# yarn start
Your application will open in your default web browser, usually at http://localhost:3000.
